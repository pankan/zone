              <p>Zone Labs has been described as the combination of a venture capital fund, and an operating company.  We invest in, or build, companies and products that leverage our innovation platform to address multiple pressing problems/opportunities.  To do this, we bring together some of the brightest minds in a high-energy, creative, 'get-it-done' environment out of our centres in Bangalore, Goa, and Silicon Valley (more to come).  Our goal is to build products and services that are global in scope, deep in impact, and have disruptive commercial and social potential.</p>
              <p>Our founding team have previously founded or incubated several iconic start-ups that have created billions of dollars of value, and tens of thousands of jobs across the globe.  We believe we know what we are doing.</p>
              <p>We are currently in the process of completing and rolling out two products that leverage AI in profound ways.  We have good reason to think our initiatives will be 'game-changers' in their respective sectors.</p>
              <p>We are looking to expand our team and are looking for select individuals who share our passion, drive, and commitment. The 'typical' Zone person is someone with high intellect, driven by curiosity, who seeks 'experience', and has a deep desire to make an impact. They are rebels who detest the normal, the predictable, the average.  They seek to work with the brightest minds, to solve intractable problems, and are not afraid to dream, and to do whatever it takes to achieve the dream. </p>
              <p>Positions are open in Bangalore and Goa.  Compensation will be competitive in the near-term, and potentially significant in the medium-term with stock options.  Learning will be high, and the work environment will be beyond anything you might have thought possible.</p>
